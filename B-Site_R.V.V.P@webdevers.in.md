## Description

### Project 1(Voice Controlled)

This project is a voice controlled website. We have build it in a way that every part and very feature of this site can be accessed by voice.

#### Important Precaustions

- While using this site try to minimize the use of mouse.
- Try to speak clear will commanding the site.

### Project 2(Non Voice Controlled)

#### Need

Project 1 is good for blink people, but isn't that good for common people. The reasons are as follows:

- Its is a bit slow because it include ajax call, plus use of modules like gtts and speech-recognition slow the app.

- Use of mouse instead of voice can create problems like speech overlapping and more.

Hence need of a _**Non Voice Controlled**_ site arise.

### Common Features

The site has a login system. You need to login to enjoy the services like music, news, dairy. In the news section first the titles of latest news are spoken and then of the sorted news. The news is sorted into three categories:

- business
- entertainment
- sports

you can choose any one at a time.

The music section contains music sorted as follows:

- Sorted by Years
- Sorted by Languages
- Sorted by Artists

In the diary section the stories can be added by two ways:

- Oral way
- By typing

The site also has an about us page and a contact us page.

## Usage

### Project(Voice Controlled)

> Being a voice controlled site one can use it using voice. The only precausions are, you need to have a good internet connection and your system should have a well working microphone.

### Project(Non Voice Controlled)

> You can run this site without any such precausions mentioned above.

## Applications

> This application is a great help for Blind people. It has a good range of functionality right from latest news to a range of songs to a diary for storing your past, present, future.

> The diary can also be used for storing notes(#Save_Paper).

## Future scope

> This project is mainly dependent on its voice input and output. Hence, improvement in modules like speech-recognition, gtts(google-text-to-speech) plays a vital role in the sites improvement.

> More music can also be added to the site.

> More options can be added to the news page (description of each news, etc).
