## Technology stack

Tools and technologies that you learnt and used in the project.

1. Flask - For Backend
2. HTML CSS JS and Bootstrap - For Frontend
3. BeautifulSoup (bs4) - For Web Scrapping



## Web Scrapping

We scraped ```http://www.openculture.com/``` for getting the data


    url = "http://www.openculture.com/"
    course_dict = [{},{},{},{},{},{}]  #list of 6 dictionaries
    sub_url=["computer_science_free_courses","free-online-data-science-courses",
             "economics_free_courses","math_free_courses","physics_free_courses",
             "astronomy-free-online-courses"]
    csv_files=["computerscience","datascience","economics","math","physics","astronomy"]
    #extraction of data
    for i in range(len(sub_url)):
        course_no = 0
        url_new = url + sub_url[i]
        response = requests.get(url_new)
        data = response.text
        soup = BeautifulSoup(data, 'html.parser')
        contents = soup.find_all("ul")
        for content in contents:
            names = content.find_all("strong")
            for name in names:
                if len(name.text)>=6:
                    course_link = []
                    course_name = name.text
                    courses = name.find_next_siblings("a")
                    course_provider = name.find_parent("li").text[len(course_name)+1:]
                    count =0
                    for course in courses:
                        if count<=3 :
                            course_link.append(course.get('href'))
                            count +=1

                    #print(course_no,course_name,course_provider,course_link)
                    (course_dict[i])[course_no] = [course_name,course_provider,course_link]
                    course_no += 1

                else:
                    continue 

## Project Setup

Type this command in the git bash terminal
```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dhairyashah1/CodeCrafters-CourseSuggestingWebApp
```

You must also have [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) installed

Then you must install the required dependencies. In this repository 'requirements.txt' contains a list of all dependencies required for the project.

## Applications
>The Course Suggesting Web App suggests courses available in various domains from across many websites offering them.

## Future scope
* Using ML and AI further our recommendations will become user specific. Suggestions based on star ratings from various sites is one of them. Also the number of course domains and courses may increase enabling the user to find everything at one place.
* Also blogging feature will enable the users to write educational blogs, thus making it a fully educational site.
