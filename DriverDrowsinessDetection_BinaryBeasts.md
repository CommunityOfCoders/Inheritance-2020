## Description
> This Project is a combination of computer vision , front-end and back-end development . In this with the help of a web camera a continous image (known as video) 
is taken as input and with the help of some  eucledian mathematics , algorithims , inbuilt packages and models of python , if the user is found to be sleepy/drowsy an alarm beeps making the user aware of conditions so that proper care can be taken of his/her sleepy situation. 

> It has an accuracy of approximately 95% and a reaction time of less than 1 second making it efficient.    

> It can also be used by students to keep themselves awake while studing as the alarm will wake them up whenever they feel drowsy allowing them to continue their studies without any tension of drowsing off.
    
### Few Code snippets:
* To get face landmarks-
```sh
detector = dlib.get_frontal_face_detector()
predictor = dlib.shape_predictor('shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat')

def detect_shape(self, gray, rect, predictor):
   shape = predictor(gray, rect)
   shape = face_utils.shape_to_np(shape)
   return shape
   
shape = obj.detect_shape(gray, rect, predictor)
```
* To calculate euclidean distance-
```sh
def calculate_ratio(eye):
    A = d.euclidean(eye[1], eye[5])
    B = d.euclidean(eye[2], eye[4])
    C = d.euclidean(eye[0], eye[3])
    ratio = (A + B) / (2.0 * C)
    return ratio
```

## Applications
> It can be used to detect if a driver is drowsy or not during driving and plays alarm if the driver is drowsy resulting in prevention of accidents.  
  
> It can also be used by students to keep themselves awake while studying as the alarm will wake them up whenever they feel drowsy allowing them to continue their studies without any tension of drowsing off.
    
        
## Future scope
> The project now uses the web-cam to capture the images of driver to process upon. Further work includes -
- [ ] Providing feature to capture images using Raspberry-Pi or other external camera
- [ ] Building this model into a hardware which can be directly fixed onto a place  
- [ ] Making this into a web-application and can be used by any external server as well
