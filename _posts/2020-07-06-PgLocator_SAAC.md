## Technology stack

Tools and technologies learnt and used in the project.

1. Java
2. Android-studio and Firebase

## Project Setup

* install through APK
* Clone the repository by given link and open the folder with android studio.



## Usage
* user needs to register himself.
* After login, he/she will be able to search sites and add those to liked options, make payments to owner or tiffin services and add blogs/adds to home feed.
* If a particular person is here to only upload his/her site, he may use the owner signup option where he doesn't need to provide his personal details.
* Without Login, one will only be able to view sites but will neither be able to add sites/blogs to liked section nor will be able to post blogs or add sites.


## Applications
>A non localite in search of PG/hostel will never come to know which pg/hostel would suit/meet his requirements the best without proper knowledge of facilities provided by that facility as well as avaialble in that vicinity.
What our app basically does is

* provides information about the hostel along with facilities available in that vicinity.
* compares hostels/pg based on cost, facilities(food availabilty, furnishment, etc) and allows the user to make the best choice.
* search for Tiffin providers (Catering services) if any facility doesnt provide the same.
* pay rent/tiffin payments through online transactions using UPI secure payment method.
* gives a platform to make his/her site available as PG/House for rent to the rest of the world. 
* saves brokerage.

## Future scope

Some features which can be added are as follows :
### Filters
adding sorting filters(based on cost, name, etc) and seraching filters(based on facilities provided like Food,Furnishment,AC,etc) would help user to more easily locate the required hostel.

### Chat Feature 
adding a chat feature and being able to talk with owner in the app itself would give a more lively experience.

### live location
accessing the live location would make the user locate that particular hostel more easily,

### Reviews, wallet and redeem code options
enabling a comment section below each site would make the user more aware about what the actual situation is and its always the user reviews which make us aware about the quality, service and other features.
Also wallet points gained on bringing other users through code would also help users to bring more and more users to this app.
