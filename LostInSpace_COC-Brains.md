# **Description**
You are now chosen to unlock the greatest mystery of 21st century : **Where did Ms. Vishnoi disappear?**
Ms. Vishnoi, the scientist sought to reveal the alien-like happenings in your time. But she mysteriously disappeared a few days ago. You reach her lab and find strange things after some searching. You also come across some coordinates and a peculiar machine where you try to insert those but everything starts rumbling and you find yourself travelling to a different world ! Is this the place where Ms. Vishnoi travelled? Can you save her and unravel the ongoings ? Is this all or *is there more to this quest?*
***Play now and follow the instructions to find out !***
This is a **3D desktop game** with **first person mode** throughout. In it's main part, you face and **terminate aliens** using the weapon. Here are some code snippets:
* Behaviour of enemy following the player:


       public void Update() { float distance = Vector3.Distance(target.position, transform.position);
    
        if (distance > lookRadius)
        {
            _animator.SetBool("IsWalking", false);
            agent.enabled = false;
        }

        if (distance <= lookRadius)
        {
            AlienSound.Play();
            agent.enabled = true;
            agent.destination = target.position;
            _animator.SetBool("IsWalking", true);
            _animator.SetBool("Attack", false);

            if (agent.remainingDistance <= agent.stoppingDistance)
            {
                agent.destination = target.position;
                _animator.SetBool("Attack", true);
                      
                StartCoroutine(healthreduce());
            }
        }
   
    
* The scene where player finds the scientist is trigerred at the end after killing all aliens:

{

    private void Start()
    {
        enemies = GameObject.FindGameObjectsWithTag("Enemy");
        KillAllText.SetActive(false);
    }
    private void OnTriggerEnter(Collider other)
    {
        if(other.CompareTag("Player") && PlayerManager.instance.EnemiesKilled==52)
        {
            transition.SetTrigger("start");
            SceneManager.LoadScene("ScientistTalk");   
        }

        else
        {
            StartCoroutine(Killallfirst());
        }
    }

    IEnumerator Killallfirst()
    {
        KillAllText.SetActive(true);
        yield return new WaitForSeconds(3f);
        KillAllText.SetActive(false);
    }
